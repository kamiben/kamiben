Tech.arthion.fr is no more ! Welcome to benjamin.combe.pm !

The old articles, in french, have all be imported, imported from their own old git repo. This website is now hosted on Github Pages (see [it's repo](https://github.com/kamiben/kamiben.github.io) ), with the easy start template [jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

From now on I think the future articles should be in English, as they would be able to help a lot more people.
