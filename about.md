I am a Computer Engineer and Web Technologist.

### More Information
 I lead software deployment for 3 years at Carrefour where I coordinated a team of 10 projects manager, where I had the incredible opportunity of discovering the world of mass market distibution with a wonderful team.

 I worked as a sysop at ERDF where I managed the run of a strategic application.

 Currently I am working as a sysop/devop at Agipi in Strasbourg, France, making sure prod environments run as smoothly as possible and taking coffees with the devs !

 I am also the chief technologist of the [Institut Confluence](http://www.institutconfluences.com/) and [Primo France](http://www.primofrance.org/), where I take care of the network maintenance as an auto-entrepreneur.
